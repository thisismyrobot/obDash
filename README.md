# Toyota code

Some sandboxing code for OBD logging and display for my little Toyota :)

# Note

Um, this is a sandbox. Nothing here is stable, but if there's something you
like, have fun with it.

## Windows setup

This is just for those who want to look at it on a Windows box. *nix
instructions to follow.

In the current folder:

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv venv
    venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
